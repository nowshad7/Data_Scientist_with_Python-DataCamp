### Data Scientist with Python (DataCamp)
In this track, I learnt how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills. Through interactive exercises, I got hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. I worked with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP), improved Python skills, and my journey to becoming a confident data scientist.
